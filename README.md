# PurpleAirAPI R Package

`Access air quality data through the PurpleAir API`

## Background

TODO

## Institutional Support

[Mazama Science](https://mazamascience.com) develops and maintains the package 
as part of its ongoing relationships with federal, state and local air quality 
agencies.

## Installation

This package is designed to be used with [R](https://cran.r-project.org) 
(>= 3.5) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) so make sure you have those 
installed first.

Until the package is available on CRAN or to get the latest development version, 
users will want to install the **devtools** package to have access to the latest 
version of the package from Github.

The following packages should be installed by typing the following at the 
RStudio console:

```
# Note that vignettes require knitr and rmarkdown
install.packages('knitr')
install.packages('rmarkdown')
install.packages('MazamaCoreUtils')
devtools::install_github('MazamaScience/PurpleAirAPI')
```
